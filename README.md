<b>It does not have to be perfect, but it does have to look something like that design!</b>


### 4 - Unit Tests

Write a unit test in newspaper.component.spec.ts

It must check that:
- The Newspaper Header Image Exists
- The Story Headline Exists
- The Story Image Exists
- The Story Text Exists

Hint:

Look at the unit tests for the not-found page and the header component, they contain very similar code to what you need to write!
You will have to declare any sub-components that component displays and import any modules it uses.

Unit tests are hard for beginners, so watch my solution for help. Then try it yourself!

'npm run start' to run the unit tests.


### Images

Check the src/assets/images folder for the images you will need for this puzzle.


### Use this text as the news story:

Safety Meeting Ends In Accident

Story:

The day started with a safety meeting, that wouldn't stay safe for long! At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, Gary Black was in a hurry to arrive at the meeting room and accidentally slipped on a banana.
Gary reportedly wobbled like a tipsy giraffe, and was sent sprawling into several nearby pot plants.
